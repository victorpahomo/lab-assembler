# Assembly Language Lab Exercises

This repository contains assembly language lab exercises designed for students at the Universidad Internacional de la Rioja. These exercises cover three key topics: finding the largest number, finding the smallest number, and generating the Fibonacci series. Each exercise includes validation checks and accepts command-line parameters.

## Prerequisites

Before you can compile and run the assembly language files, you'll need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download the MARS assembler and simulator from the following link:

[Download MARS Assembler and Simulator](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm)

Make sure you have Java and MARS installed before proceeding.

## Usage

To compile and execute the assembly language files using MARS, follow these steps:

1. Download and install MARS if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open MARS by running the following command in your terminal (replace `Mars.jar` with the actual path to the `Mars.jar` file):
java -jar /path/to/Mars.jar


4. In MARS, open the assembly file you want to work with (e.g., `FindLargest.asm`, `FindSmallest.asm`, or `Fibonacci.asm`).
5. Use MARS to assemble and run the code. Follow the instructions in the MARS documentation if you are unfamiliar with its usage.

## Exercises

1. **Find Largest Number**: This exercise focuses on finding the largest number among a set of input values.

2. **Find Smallest Number**: This exercise aims to find the smallest number among a set of input values.

3. **Fibonacci Series**: This exercise demonstrates the generation of the Fibonacci series.

Each exercise folder contains the assembly code, input files, and validation checks to ensure the correctness of your implementation. Refer to the individual exercise folders for more details on how to run and test each program.

Feel free to explore the exercises and use them as a learning resource for assembly language programming.

Happy coding!
